# SPOT Framework Documentation

Welcome to the SPOT Framework Documentation repository! This document provides an overview of the SPOT (Swift Prioritization of Tasks) Framework, a structured approach for effective task prioritization, particularly in high-pressure environments like SRE and DevOps.

## Overview

The SPOT Framework is designed to help teams quickly prioritize tasks, especially during incident handling, system design, or development workflows. The framework breaks down task prioritization into four simple, actionable steps:

1. **Swift** - Quickly evaluate the urgency of tasks.
2. **Prioritize** - Rank tasks based on impact and importance.
3. **Optimize** - Refine the execution of prioritized tasks for efficiency.
4. **Triage** - Address any ambiguity by revisiting prioritization.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Prioritization**: Use SPOT to stay focused and responsive under pressure.
- **Dynamic Workflow Adaptation**: Adapt the framework to the specific needs of your team and environment.
- **Clear Guidance**: Provides simple but effective steps to ensure critical tasks are handled promptly.

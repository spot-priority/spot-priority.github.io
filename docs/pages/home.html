        <h2>What is SPOT?</h2>
        <p>SPOT (Survey, Prioritize, Optimize, Take Action) is a rapid decision-making tool inspired by medical triage.
            It helps engineers quickly assess, prioritize, and act on tasks, ensuring focus on what matters most in
            critical situations. Instead of ranking tasks exhaustively, SPOT filters them step-by-step until the next
            essential action is clear.</p>

        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Survey (S):</strong> Quickly assess all tasks to identify critical issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize (P):</strong> Focus on tasks with the highest urgency.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimize (O):</strong> Choose tasks that offer the greatest return on effort.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Action (T):</strong> Act immediately on the most important tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why SPOT?</h2>
        <p>Unlike traditional frameworks like RICE, SPOT is designed for speed, allowing you to make decisions fast
            without the need for extensive calculations or collaboration. Whether you're handling incidents or managing
            high-pressure tasks, SPOT helps you take action when every second counts.</p>

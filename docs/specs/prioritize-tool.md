# SPOT Framework Prioritization Tool Design Specification

## Overview
The SPOT Framework Prioritization Tool is a web-based application designed to help users prioritize tasks using the SPOT (Survey, Prioritize, Optimize, Take Action) framework. The tool provides an intuitive interface for managing tasks across different priority levels and impact categories.

## Core Features

### 1. Task Management
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign tasks to primary or secondary groups
- Set urgency levels (higher/lower)
- Set impact levels (more/less)
- Track task status (pending/in progress/blocked/completed)
- Drag and drop reordering
- Import/Export functionality
- Demo task system

### 2. Four-Step Process
1. **Survey**
   - Initial task collection
   - Basic categorization into primary/secondary groups
   - Simple drag-and-drop reordering
   - Task input with group assignment

2. **Prioritize**
   - Group tasks by urgency
   - Visual separation of higher/lower urgency tasks
   - Maintain primary/secondary grouping
   - Drag and drop between urgency levels

3. **Optimize**
   - Further categorization by impact
   - Visual organization of tasks by urgency and impact
   - Advanced drag-and-drop between categories
   - Impact-based task grouping

4. **Take Action**
   - Focus on highest priority tasks
   - Status tracking and updates
   - Progress monitoring
   - Visual status indicators
   - Task completion tracking

### 3. Full Control View
- Comprehensive task management interface
- Direct access to all task properties
- Bulk operations and filtering
- Demo task functionality
- Grid-based layout for better organization
- Column-based task properties
- Quick category changes via dropdowns

## Technical Specifications

### Data Structure
```javascript
Task {
    id: number,          // Unique identifier
    name: string,        // Task name
    group: string,       // 'primary' or 'secondary'
    urgency: string,     // 'higher' or 'lower'
    impact: string,      // 'more' or 'less'
    status: string,      // 'pending', 'in_progress', 'blocked', 'completed'
    rank: number,        // Position in list
    isDemo: boolean      // Flag for demo tasks
}
```

### User Interface Components

#### 1. Progress Bar
- Visual indicator of current step
- Clickable navigation between steps
- Clear visual feedback for completed steps
- Step labels and indicators

#### 2. Task Groups
- Collapsible sections for different categories
- Visual distinction between primary and secondary tasks
- Drop zones for drag-and-drop operations
- Group headers with task counts

#### 3. Task Items
- Drag handle for reordering
- Status indicators
- Quick action buttons
- Category selectors
- Visual feedback during drag operations

#### 4. Control Panel
- Import/Export functionality
- Full Control toggle
- Demo task management
- Clear all tasks option
- File input for JSON import

### Drag and Drop Implementation
- HTML5 native drag and drop
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Drop zone highlighting
- Category-based restrictions
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Data Persistence
- Local storage for task data
- JSON import/export functionality
- Automatic state management
- Data validation and error handling

## User Experience Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Primary tasks are visually distinct from secondary tasks
2. Higher urgency tasks are highlighted
3. More impact tasks are emphasized
4. Status colors provide quick visual feedback
5. Clear visual separation between groups

### Interaction Patterns
1. Drag and drop for reordering
2. Drop-down menus for category changes
3. Arrow buttons for fine-tuned positioning
4. Status updates via checkboxes and buttons

### Responsive Design
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Maintains functionality on mobile devices
- Optimized touch interactions
- Grid layout adjustments for smaller screens

## Future Enhancements
1. Advanced filtering and search
2. Custom categories and labels
3. Progress tracking and analytics
4. Export to various formats
5. Keyboard shortcuts
6. Undo/Redo functionality
7. Task templates
8. Bulk operations
9. Task dependencies
10. Task history

## Performance Considerations
1. Efficient DOM updates
2. Optimized drag and drop operations
3. Minimal re-rendering
4. Responsive state management
5. Optimized event listeners

## Security Considerations
1. Local data storage
2. Safe file import/export
3. Data validation
4. Error handling
5. Input sanitization

## Accessibility
1. Keyboard navigation
2. Screen reader support
3. High contrast options
4. Clear focus indicators
5. ARIA labels
6. Semantic HTML
